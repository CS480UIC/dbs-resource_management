First Normal Form - All non-key columns depend on primary key

Second Normal Form - The second normal form states that - 
            "A table is in second normal form when all non-key columns depend on the whole primary key."

The tables in the database are already in second normal form, as all non-key coloumns depend on the whole primary key.

Third Normal Form - The third normal form states that-
             "A table is in third normal form if, whenever a non-key column A depends on column B, then B is unique. Columns A and B may be simple or composite."

The tables are in third normal form. We say this because we do not have any coloumn that depends on a non-key column. All our columns depend on the primary key.
