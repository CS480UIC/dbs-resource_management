# Database description
Since this is a resource management project, Ideally we would need to collect data about the resources available and also the schools that want to use it.

We have a table that collects the different types of resources available and how many such resources are available for each type(15 laptops, 2 chemistry labs etc). 
The location of some resources(like labs or sports fields) is also stored. We also maintain a list of schools that are permitted to access these resources. 
Then we have a booking table, where me manage the booking of resources(School xyz has booked chemistry lab "a" for Friday from 2:30 to 4:00). 
We make changes to the tables of the data base according to the bookings being made
